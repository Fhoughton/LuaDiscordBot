# Overview
This bot is an interactive bot for the chat platform [Discord](https://discord.com/). It was created as part of **Discord Bot Jam 2024**, following the **puzzle** theme. It provides an interface for a puzzle game based around solving mathematical problems based on data stacks. Lua was chosen as I was aiming to learn it at the time, and I feel working on this project gave me a great understanding of the language, due to its relative simplicity.

**The bot features:**

- Per-user save files, allowing multiple users
- 5 commands to interact with the bot/game state
- Prefix switching
