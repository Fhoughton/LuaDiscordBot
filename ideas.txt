- A TIS style puzzle game with stacks
- Make it human readable, about a robot who works with paper stacks
- Show stack at each step and let user do multiple steps
- Should be about a set of inputs to a set out outputs
- Use discord reactions for inputs!?! So can react with a 1 to enter a 1 and shit!?!
